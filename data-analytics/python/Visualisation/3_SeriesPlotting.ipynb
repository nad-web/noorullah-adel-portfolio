    "# Plotting with `Series`\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point we are quite proficient with handling Pandas `Series` objects. We know how to access and modify values by calling suitable methods on a `Series` object. Indeed, the common Pandas workflow --- be it with `Series` or `DataFrame`s --- is to \"massage\" the data with some method calls to bring it into the desired form. This can be selecting a subset of values, transforming or aggregating values. Once the data has been prepared, the next step often is to visualize it. As discussed in the [introduction](why-bother-with-visualizing-data\n",
    ") compelling visualizations are key aspect of analyzing and understanding data. In the context of data science and machine learning visualizing data is the corner stone of [*exploratory data analysis*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploratory_data_analysis).\n",
    "\n",
    "The Pandas library offers a quite convenient interface to the [`Matplotlib`](https://matplotlib.org/) library. While a bit aged, Matplotlib offers many powerful tools to easily generate two-dimensional plots. At the same time we should probably also mention [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) and [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/). Seaborn is a wrapper around Matplotlib with the goal to make commonly-used plots (e.g., histograms, scatter plots, etc.) easily accessible from a high-level Python API. Plotly also has a focus on interactive plots (zooming into plots, reading values from hovering the mouse over data points shown in the plot) which is not supported by Matplotlib.\n",
