Introduction
In this project, you will use BlocksCAD to design a 3D bug or insect using geometric shapes.

If you have access to a 3D printer, you can print the bug you design. Once your bug is printed, you can add details using permanent marker pens.

You’ll also be able to use the skills you have learned to design your own bug or other creature using geometric shapes.

The bugs make great rewards for debugging!

What you will make
The finished bug looks like this:


<img width="890" height="583" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/abdcc723-9d2b-4b1f-957f-48e420be214b" />

Most 3D printers can only print in one colour, so you can add details using permanent markers to make your bug look even better.

i: What you will need

Hardware
A 3D printer, and filament in a colour of your choice
Coloured permanent marker pens in a range of colours — metallic colours work well
Software
This project can be completed in a web browser using [BlocksCAD](blockscad3d.com/editor/)
What you will learn
3D modelling with geometric shapes (spheres)
Using scale to stretch geometic shapes

Give your bug a body

[Open the BlocksCAD editor in a web browser](blockscad3d.com/editor/)
Now create the body of your bug.

Flatten the base of the body
Now flatten the base of the body to make your bug more realistic. A model with a flat base is also easier to 3D print!

To do this, you can simply remove a cuboid from your model using the difference block.

Add a head to your bug
Now create a head for the bug.

Create legs
Now the bug needs six legs!

Challenge: design your own bug
Now it’s time to design your own bug using your new knowledge of BlocksCAD!

Tips:

Most 3D printers can only print in one colour. You can use colours in BlocksCAD to design the look you want and then add details with permanent marker pens after printing.

Don’t make any part of your bug too slim, or it will break easily.

Avoid adding parts that have gaps below them when they are 3D printed, because 3D printers can’t print in mid-air. (It is possible to print using supports to hold up parts of your model, but this makes printing more complicated.)

Think about how big your bug will be. If you make it too big, then it will take a long time to print and use a lot of filament.
