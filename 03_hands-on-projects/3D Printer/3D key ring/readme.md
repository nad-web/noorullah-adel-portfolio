# 3D Key Ring Project
[Doc](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/blockscad-coder-keyring/1)
## Introduction
Design a ‘CODER’ key ring that can be 3D printed. BlocksCAD is a 3D model editor that you can use in a web browser on a computer or tablet. You drag and drop code blocks to design 3D models that can be exported for 3D printing.

The key ring will measure around 14mm by 50mm.

## Objectives
- Learn to design a key ring using BlocksCAD.
- Understand the fundamentals of 3D modeling and printing.

## You Will Need (Optional)
- A 3D printer and filament (solid colors work best).
- A split ring for making the key ring (A 19mm diameter split ring works well).

## Steps
### 1. What You Will Make
Design a ‘CODER’ key ring that can be 3D printed.

### 2. Create 3D Text
Learn how to use BlocksCAD to create text for your key ring.

### 3. Change Thickness
Adjust the thickness of your text to ensure it will 3D print correctly.

### 4. Save Your Project
Learn how to save your project in BlocksCAD.

### 5. Challenges
After creating your key ring, try to design your own variation!

### 6. 3D Print Your Key Ring
Instructions on how to export and prepare your design for 3D printing.

### 7. Assemble Your Key Ring
Final steps to put your key ring together with the printed parts.

## Conclusion
This project allows you to develop skills in 3D design and printing while creating a customized key ring.
